## Summary

Welcome to the MLLM-Hands-On GitHub repository dedicated to studying and practicing with Large Language Models (LLM). This repository contains various experiments and trials that I have conducted. For a detailed explanation about the code and the underlying technology and science, you can refer to my Medium blog at the following link:

## Installation

Each experiment is organized into separate folders within this repository. Inside each folder, you will find a requirements.txt file that lists the necessary packages to run the experiment. To run the code, I recommend using a virtual environment in VSCode.

## Data-Usage

All the data required to run the code is conveniently located in the same root directory as the associated notebooks and scripts. You are welcome to explore and utilize these datasets for your own LLM experiments.

## Feedback

Your feedback and contributions are always appreciated!
