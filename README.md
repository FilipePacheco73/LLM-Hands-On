## Summary

Welcome to my LLM-Hands-On GitHub repository dedicated to studying and practicing with Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository contains various experiments and trials that I have conducted. 

### Why Vector Databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Are Important

As we explore the capabilities of LLMs, one of the key challenges is efficiently managing and querying large amounts of text data. This is where Vector Databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) come into play:

- **Vector Databases:**
  - Vector databases allow us to store and manage high-dimensional vector representations of text data. These vectors are generated by encoding text using models like Sentence Transformers.
  - By storing data in vector form, we can perform efficient similarity searches, making it possible to quickly find relevant pieces of information based on their semantic content rather than exact keyword matches.
  - This is particularly useful for applications like document retrieval, question answering, and recommendation systems.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing.
  - In a RAG system, relevant documents or data points are first retrieved from a database using similarity search, and then these retrieved items are used to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
  - This approach enhances the capabilities of LLMs by grounding their responses in real-world data, leading to more informative and reliable outputs.

In this repository, we implement and experiment with these concepts using tools like FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to create vector libraries and perform similarity searches. By integrating these techniques, we aim to enhance the performance and applicability of LLMs in various tasks.

## Installation

Each experiment is organized into separate folders within this repository. Inside each folder, you will find a `requirements.txt` file that lists the necessary packages to run the experiment. To run the code, I recommend using a virtual environment in VSCode. 

### Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/filipespacheco/LLM-Hands-On.git
    cd LLM-Hands-On
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Usage

All the data required to run the code is conveniently located in the same root directory as the associated notebooks and scripts. You are welcome to explore and utilize these datasets for your own LLM experiments.

  - `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the vector library project.
  - `vector_library_creation.py`: The main script to create and utilize the vector library.

## Usage Guide

### Script: `vector_library_creation.py`

This script demonstrates how to create and use a vector library with FAISS for problem-solution data.

#### Main Components:

1. **LoadLLM Class:**
   - Loads a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model for encoding text.

2. **LoadFile Class:**
   - Loads an Excel file containing problem and solution data.
   - Constructs a descriptive text for each problem-solution pair.

3. **DataTreatment Class:**
   - Creates an index for the data to keep track of each entry.

4. **VectorLibraryCreation Class:**
   - Encodes the problem-solution descriptions into vectors.
   - Normalizes these vectors and creates a FAISS vector library.
   - Saves the FAISS vector library to a file.

5. **SearchContent Class:**
   - Searches the FAISS vector library to find the most similar entries to a given query.

### Example Usage

To run the script and search for content similar to a query (e.g., "Battery"), follow these steps:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated and the required packages are installed.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python Vector-Library/vector_library_creation.py
    ```

This will create the FAISS vector library and perform a search for the query "Battery". The results will be printed to the console.
